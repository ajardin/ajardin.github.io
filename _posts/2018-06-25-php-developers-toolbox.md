During the summer meetup organized with the AFUP Limoges, I gave a conference where I explained why it's essential to
use relevant tools to be efficient as a developer. Even if the talk was in French, all my slides are in English except
the title, which is not the most important.

My talk lasted about an hour during which I briefly covered seven different topics.
* Docker
* Code Styles
* Static Analysis
* Security Audits
* Makefile
* Git Hooks
* Blackfire

There is no specific order to follow because the talk was built to be an overview of what it's possible to implement at
the developer level to increase quality and productivity.

Thanks for reading!
