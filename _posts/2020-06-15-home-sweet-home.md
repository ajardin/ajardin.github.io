This article is a bit special because for once, it is not technical at all. And this is not a joke about localhost
either. The COVID-19 crisis has impacted everyone, but at very different levels. Do not be afraid, I will not discuss
politics, medical treatments, or worse, conspiracy theories here.

I am one of the developers who was fortunate enough to be able to continue working safely from the comfort of my home.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for all developers, and certainly not all professions. Therefore you will not see me
complaining about this situation.

The confinement and the social distancing lead us, even unconsciously, to introspection. Is full-remote work made for
me? Am I satisfied with the eco-system in which I work? What could I do to be more efficient and have more pleasure in
my daily life? What do I really enjoy working on?

On my side, I have come to the conclusion that I regret having put this blog aside for so long.

Because one of the things I appreciate the most in this job is the exchange with other developers. We have both the
chance to learn new things every day, but also the duty to maintain ourselves up to date so we do not get overwhelmed by
all the innovations around us.

That's why I regularly give conferences, why I give courses in different trainings, and why I initiated this blog
several years ago... Now, it is time to get back to work and start publishing new articles.

In the coming weeks, I will start to explain step by step how I built a PHP project as a PHAR archive to orchestrate
my local Docker environments.

See you soon!
